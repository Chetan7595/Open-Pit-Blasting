## Introduction

The code in this repository performs various tasks related to the Open Pit Blasting Machine Learning project. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series analysis, autoregressive modeling, and model evaluation. The goal is to provide insights into open pit blasting processes and make predictions based on historical data.

## Installation

To run the code, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chetan7595/open-pit-blasting-ml.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd open-pit-blasting-ml/`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Place the dataset file "Assignment1.csv" in the project directory.

## Usage

To execute the code, follow the steps below:

1. Run the `main.py` file: `python main.py`

The code will perform data preprocessing, generate EDA visualizations, conduct time series analysis, build autoregressive models, evaluate model performance, and display the results.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is stored in the "Assignment1.csv" file. It contains relevant data related to open pit blasting, such as blasting parameters, geological features, and corresponding outcomes.

Ensure that the "Assignment1.csv" file is present in the project directory before running the code.

## Results

The code generates various results, including data preprocessing statistics, EDA visualizations (histograms, box plots, heatmaps), time series analysis plots (ACF, PACF, seasonal decomposition), autoregressive model summaries, residuals analysis, and prediction evaluations (RMSE, mean absolute error).

Review the generated plots, model summaries, and evaluation metrics to gain insights into the open pit blasting process and assess the performance of the implemented models.
